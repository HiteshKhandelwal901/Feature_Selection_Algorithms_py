#Step 1 : Read the data

#Step 2 : Iterative over feature space starting with all features

         #Step 3 :  Train a random forest on a given feature space

         #Step 4 :  get the gini score for each features
         # 
         #Step 5 : Rank them from highest to lowest 
         #  
         #Step 6 : eliminate last 5 features

         #Step 7 : Construct the new dataset with the new features 

         #Step 8 : repeat
